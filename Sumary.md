# Data Analysis and Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Analysis and Data Science portfolio repository. Here, you will find a collection of my projects that showcase my skills and expertise in various aspects of data analysis and data science.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In these projects, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present data clearly.

### 2. Data Preparation
Data preparation is a crucial step in my workflow. These projects highlight my ability to preprocess and transform raw data into a clean dataset ready for analysis. This includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and in some cases, normalizing data.

### 3. Data Cleaning
Accurate analysis requires clean data. My projects demonstrate thorough data cleaning techniques to remove inconsistencies, handle outliers, correct errors, and ensure the integrity of the datasets.

### 4. Feature Engineering
In these projects, I create new features from existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models. This involves techniques like creating interaction terms, polynomial features, and aggregating data.

### 5. Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling
I apply various machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling techniques to solve complex problems. This includes regression analysis, classification and clustering

### 6. Data Visualization
Effective data visualization is essential to communicate insights. My projects include creating impactful visualizations using tools like PowerBI.
